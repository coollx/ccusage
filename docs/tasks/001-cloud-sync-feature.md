# Task 001: Cloud Sync Feature with Firebase

**Status**: In Progress (Phase 5 of 6 completed)
**Created**: 2025-07-26
**Updated**: 2025-07-28
**Priority**: P1 (High)

## Objective
Implement a comprehensive cloud synchronization feature for ccusage that enables usage data aggregation across multiple devices using user-owned Firebase projects, ensuring complete data privacy and user control while providing seamless cross-device usage tracking.

## Background
Currently, ccusage operates entirely locally, reading Claude Code usage data from JSONL files on the local filesystem. Users with multiple devices (Mac, Linux, Windows) cannot see aggregated usage across all their devices. This feature will introduce cloud synchronization using user-owned Firebase projects, ensuring that users maintain complete control and ownership of their data while enabling cross-device aggregation.

## Requirements

### User Stories
- As a developer using Claude Code on multiple devices, I want to see my total usage across all devices so that I can track my overall spending
- As a user, I want my usage data to sync when I run commands so that I can see aggregated historical data across devices
- As a user, I want my data to remain private and secure so that I can trust the cloud sync feature
- As a user, I want the tool to work offline so that I can still see local usage when not connected
- As a team lead, I want to see aggregated usage across my team members' devices so that I can manage our Claude budget

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] When running any ccusage command, the system shall sync new local data to Firebase
- [ ] No background process or daemon shall run when ccusage is not actively being used
- [ ] Given multiple devices with the same Claude account, historical commands (daily/monthly/session) shall show aggregated data
- [ ] Live monitoring commands shall continue to show only current device data for clarity
- [ ] The system must handle data deduplication to prevent counting the same usage multiple times
- [ ] When offline, the system shall fall back to local-only data and queue sync operations
- [ ] Given conflicting data from multiple devices, when syncing, then the system resolves conflicts deterministically
- [ ] The system must encrypt sensitive data before sending to Firebase
- [ ] Historical commands with --cloud flag shall show device breakdowns in the output
- [ ] The system must provide clear indicators when showing cloud vs local data

### Out of Scope
- Centralized Firebase hosting (users provide their own)
- Web dashboard for viewing usage
- Manual data export/import features
- Historical data migration for existing users (addressed separately)
- Team management UI
- Firebase billing management (users handle directly with Google)

## Technical Approach

### Architecture Decisions

1. **User-Owned Firebase Architecture**:
   - Each user creates and manages their own Firebase project
   - Complete data privacy - ccusage never sees user data
   - Users control costs and data retention
   - Simple setup with provided scripts and templates
   
2. **Firebase Services Used**:
   - Firestore for structured data storage (aggregated summaries only)
   - Firebase Auth for simple authentication (no email required)
   - NO Realtime Database (keeps costs low)
   - NO Cloud Functions (simpler setup)

3. **Synchronization Architecture**:
   - **No daemon process** - sync only during command execution
   - **Aggregated data only** - no raw JSONL storage
   - **Device isolation** - each device writes to its own namespace
   - **Conflict-free** - aggregation happens on read
   - **Offline support** - queue changes in local SQLite
   - **1 year retention** - configurable by user

4. **Data Model Design**:
   - **Aggregated summaries only** - one record per device per day
   - Device-isolated paths prevent conflicts
   - User-friendly device names for readability
   - Minimal data to keep Firebase costs near zero

5. **Privacy & Security**:
   - **User owns all data** - stored in their Firebase
   - **We never see user data** - complete privacy
   - Simple Firebase Auth (anonymous by default)
   - Optional Google/GitHub linking for multi-device

6. **Cost Optimization**:
   - Aggregated data = ~365 records/device/year
   - Most users stay within Firebase free tier
   - No raw data storage = minimal costs
   - User controls their own Firebase billing

### Setup Flow for Users

#### Initial Firebase Project Setup (One-time)

```bash
# Step 1: User creates their own Firebase project
# We provide detailed guide with screenshots

# Step 2: Initialize ccusage with Firebase config
ccusage sync init

🔥 Firebase Setup for ccusage
Please enter your Firebase configuration:
> Project ID: my-ccusage-sync
> API Key: AIzaSy...
> Auth Domain: my-ccusage-sync.firebaseapp.com

✓ Config saved to ~/.ccusage/firebase.json
✓ Testing connection...
✓ Firebase connected successfully!

# Step 3: Run our setup script to configure Firebase
ccusage sync setup

📋 Setting up Firebase project...
✓ Creating Firestore indexes
✓ Deploying security rules
✓ Creating database structure
✓ Setup complete!

# Step 4: Enable sync
ccusage sync enable
> Name this device: MacBook Pro
✓ Device registered
✓ Sync enabled!
```

#### Multi-Device Setup

```bash
# Option 1: Copy config file
# Copy ~/.ccusage/firebase.json to other devices

# Option 2: Re-run setup with same Firebase project
ccusage sync init  # Enter same Firebase credentials
```

#### Sync Behavior

**No Background Process**: Sync only happens during command execution.

When you run any command:
1. **On Start**: Syncs any new local data to cloud
2. **During Execution**: 
   - Historical commands: Fetch aggregated data once
   - Live commands: Sync every 30s while running
3. **On Exit**: Final sync, then process exits completely

**Live Monitoring Behavior**:
```bash
ccusage blocks --live --cloud
# Shows: Current device only (clean interface)
# Syncs: Your data to cloud every 30s
# Does NOT: Show other devices in real-time
```

```javascript
// Example: Real-time sync for blocks --live
firebase.database()
  .ref(`users/${userId}/activeBlocks`)
  .on('value', (snapshot) => {
    // Instant push when any device updates
    updateDisplay(snapshot.val())
  })
```

#### Benefits of Unified Approach

1. **Single Connection**: One WebSocket serves all real-time needs
2. **Smart Resource Usage**: Only use real-time for commands that need it
3. **Consistent Experience**: All commands support `--cloud` uniformly
4. **Optimal Performance**: Each command uses the most efficient sync method

### Components Affected

- **New Components**:
  - `cloud-sync/`: New module for all cloud sync functionality
  - `cloud-sync/firebase-client.ts`: Firebase SDK wrapper (Firestore + Realtime DB)
  - `cloud-sync/unified-sync-engine.ts`: Intelligent sync mode selection
  - `cloud-sync/realtime-manager.ts`: WebSocket connection management
  - `cloud-sync/sync-strategies/`: Different sync implementations
    - `realtime-sync.ts`: WebSocket-based instant updates
    - `periodic-sync.ts`: Cache with timed refresh
    - `onetime-sync.ts`: Single fetch operations
  - `cloud-sync/conflict-resolver.ts`: Handle data conflicts
  - `cloud-sync/data-encryption.ts`: Encryption/decryption utilities
  - `cloud-sync/offline-queue.ts`: SQLite-based offline queue

- **Modified Components**:
  - `data-loader.ts`: Add cloud data source integration
  - `commands/*.ts`: Update to show cloud vs local indicators
  - `_types.ts`: Add cloud sync related types
  - `index.ts`: Add cloud sync initialization

### Data Model Changes

#### Device Isolation Strategy

To handle multiple concurrent ccusage instances across devices, we use a device-isolated write pattern:

```typescript
// Device Isolation Architecture
interface DeviceIsolation {
  // Each device ONLY writes to its own namespace
  writePattern: `/users/{userId}/devices/{deviceId}/usage/{date}`
  
  // Aggregation happens on read
  readPattern: `/users/{userId}/devices/*/usage/{date}`
}

// Example: Two devices running simultaneously
// Mac writes to:    /users/abc/devices/macbook-pro/usage/2025-01-15
// Linux writes to:  /users/abc/devices/work-linux/usage/2025-01-15
// No conflicts!
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No write conflicts between devices
- ✅ Each device has full autonomy
- ✅ Aggregation is conflict-free
- ✅ Device names make reports readable

**Concurrent Scenarios Handled:**
1. Multiple `blocks --live` running → Each syncs to its own path
2. Historical command while live running → Different operations, no conflict
3. Same command on multiple devices → Device-isolated writes prevent races

#### Firebase Realtime Database Structure (for live data)
```typescript
// Realtime Database paths for instant updates

#### Unified Sync Engine Implementation
```typescript
// cloud-sync/unified-sync-engine.ts
export class UnifiedSyncEngine {
  private syncStrategy: SyncStrategy
  private realtimeConnections: Map<string, DatabaseReference> = new Map()
  
  async syncForCommand(command: string, options: CommandOptions): Promise<SyncResult> {
    // Intelligent sync mode selection
    const strategy = this.selectStrategy(command, options)
    
    switch (strategy) {
      case 'realtime':
        return this.realtimeSync(command, options)
      case 'periodic':
        return this.periodicSync(command, options)
      case 'onetime':
        return this.onetimeSync(command, options)
    }
  }
  
  private selectStrategy(command: string, options: CommandOptions): SyncStrategy {
    // Real-time for live monitoring
    if (options.live || options.watch) return 'realtime'
    
    // Periodic for frequently accessed data
    if (['daily', 'session', 'blocks'].includes(command)) return 'periodic'
    
    // One-time for historical queries
    return 'onetime'
  }
  
  private async realtimeSync(command: string, options: CommandOptions) {
    // Single WebSocket connection, multiple listeners
    const path = this.getRealtimePath(command, options)
    const ref = firebase.database().ref(path)
    
    // Subscribe to changes
    ref.on('value', (snapshot) => {
      this.handleRealtimeUpdate(snapshot.val())
    })
    
    // Store reference for cleanup
    this.realtimeConnections.set(command, ref)
  }
}
```

#### Device Setup and Validation

```typescript
// cloud-sync/device-manager.ts
export class DeviceManager {
  async setupDevice(): Promise<DeviceInfo> {
    // Prompt for device name
    const deviceName = await prompt('Please provide a name for this device:')
    
    // Check uniqueness
    const isUnique = await this.checkDeviceNameUnique(deviceName)
    
    if (!isUnique) {
      console.log(`⚠️  "${deviceName}" is already taken`)
      const suggestions = this.generateSuggestions(deviceName)
      console.log('Suggestions:', suggestions.join(', '))
      return this.setupDevice() // Retry
    }
    
    // Register device
    const deviceInfo = {
      deviceId: generateUUID(),
      deviceName,
      platform: process.platform,
      createdAt: new Date().toISOString()
    }
    
    await firebase.firestore()
      .collection('users').doc(userId)
      .collection('devices').doc(deviceName)
      .set(deviceInfo)
    
    return deviceInfo
  }
  
  async checkDeviceNameUnique(name: string): Promise<boolean> {
    const doc = await firebase.firestore()
      .collection('users').doc(userId)
      .collection('devices').doc(name)
      .get()
    
    return !doc.exists
  }
}
```

#### Sync Engine with Device Isolation

```typescript
// cloud-sync/sync-engine.ts
export class SyncEngine {
  private deviceName: string
  
  async syncNewData() {
    const localData = await this.getLocalNewData()
    
    // Write ONLY to this device's path
    const batch = firebase.firestore().batch()
    
    for (const [date, data] of localData) {
      const ref = firebase.firestore()
        .collection('users').doc(this.userId)
        .collection('devices').doc(this.deviceName)
        .collection('usage').doc(date)
      
      batch.set(ref, {
        ...data,
        deviceName: this.deviceName,
        lastUpdated: new Date().toISOString()
      })
    }
    
    await batch.commit()
  }
  
  async fetchAggregatedData(date: string): Promise<AggregatedData> {
    // Read from ALL devices
    const devicesSnapshot = await firebase.firestore()
      .collection('users').doc(this.userId)
      .collection('devices')
      .get()
    
    const aggregated = {
      devices: {},
      totals: { cost: 0, tokens: 0 }
    }
    
    // Fetch usage for each device
    for (const deviceDoc of devicesSnapshot.docs) {
      const deviceName = deviceDoc.id
      const usageDoc = await deviceDoc.ref
        .collection('usage').doc(date)
        .get()
      
      if (usageDoc.exists) {
        const data = usageDoc.data()
        aggregated.devices[deviceName] = {
          totalCost: data.totalCost,
          totalTokens: data.totalTokens
        }
        aggregated.totals.cost += data.totalCost
        aggregated.totals.tokens += data.totalTokens
      }
    }
    
    return aggregated
  }
}
```

#### Sync Lifecycle (No Daemon!)

```typescript
// How sync works - NO background process
class CommandExecutor {
  async execute(command: string, options: Options) {
    // 1. Command starts
    if (syncEnabled) {
      await syncEngine.syncNewData()  // Upload any new local data
    }
    
    // 2. Run the actual command
    if (command === 'blocks' && options.live) {
      // Set up 30s interval ONLY while running
      const interval = setInterval(() => {
        syncEngine.syncNewData()
      }, 30000)
      
      // Run live monitor
      await runLiveMonitor()
      
      // Clean up interval
      clearInterval(interval)
    } else if (options.cloud) {
      // Fetch aggregated data for historical commands
      const data = await syncEngine.fetchAggregatedData()
      displayResults(data)
    }
    
    // 3. Command exits
    if (syncEnabled) {
      await syncEngine.finalSync()  // Final upload
    }
    
    // 4. Process completely exits
    process.exit(0)
  }
}
```

## Implementation Decisions

Based on user requirements and privacy considerations:

- [x] **Firebase ownership**: User-owned projects (complete privacy)
- [x] **Data retention**: 1 year (365 days) by default
- [x] **Data granularity**: Aggregated daily summaries only
- [x] **Device limit**: 10 devices per user
- [x] **Authentication**: Anonymous with optional Google/GitHub linking
- [x] **No daemon process**: Sync only during command execution

## Open Questions
- [ ] Should users be able to rename devices after initial setup?
- [ ] How to handle device removal (soft delete vs hard delete)?
- [ ] Should we support team features in the future?
- [ ] Add support for other cloud providers (AWS, Azure)?
- [ ] Should we create a companion web dashboard?

## Research Notes

### Firebase Pricing Considerations (User-Owned)

Since each user owns their Firebase project:

**Free Tier Coverage (per user)**:
- Firestore: 50K reads/day, 20K writes/day
- Storage: 1GB total
- Bandwidth: 10GB/month

**Typical Usage (1 user, 3 devices)**:
- Writes: ~90/day (3 devices × 30 syncs)
- Reads: ~30/day (checking daily reports)
- Storage: ~1MB/year (365 days × 3 devices × 1KB)
- **Cost: $0/month** (well within free tier)

**Heavy Usage (1 user, 10 devices)**:
- Writes: ~300/day
- Reads: ~100/day  
- Storage: ~3.6MB/year
- **Cost: $0/month** (still within free tier)

### Benefits of User-Owned Firebase
1. **Complete Privacy**: Your data never touches our servers
2. **Zero Cost**: Most users stay within Firebase free tier
3. **Full Control**: You own and control all your data
4. **No Lock-in**: Export or delete your data anytime
5. **Compliance Ready**: Your data, your compliance

### Alternative Solutions Considered
1. **AWS DynamoDB**: More complex setup, better for enterprise
2. **Supabase**: Open source alternative, requires more infrastructure
3. **Redis Cloud**: Better for real-time but expensive for storage
4. **MongoDB Atlas**: Good aggregation but complex sync

### Security Best Practices
- Use Firebase App Check for API protection
- Implement field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- GDPR compliance considerations for EU users

## Summary

The cloud sync feature enables cross-device usage aggregation while maintaining complete user privacy through user-owned Firebase projects.

**Key Design Principles:**

1. **Privacy First**: Users own their Firebase project and all data
2. **No Daemon**: Sync only during command execution  
3. **Simple Setup**: Automated scripts and clear documentation
4. **Zero Cost**: Designed to stay within Firebase free tier
5. **Device Isolation**: Conflict-free concurrent usage
6. **Aggregated Data**: Efficient storage of daily summaries only

**User Experience:**

```bash
# One-time setup (5 minutes)
ccusage sync init    # Configure Firebase
ccusage sync setup   # Deploy rules/indexes
ccusage sync enable  # Name device & start

# Daily usage (unchanged)
ccusage blocks --live        # Clean single-device view
ccusage daily --cloud        # See all devices aggregated
```

This design provides the perfect balance of functionality, privacy, and simplicity for expert programmers who value data ownership.

### Example Output with Device Names

```bash
$ ccusage daily --cloud

## Recent Changes and Issues (2025-07-28)

### Firebase Structure Simplification
- **Major Change**: Removed unnecessary user layer from Firebase data structure
- **Rationale**: Each Firebase project belongs to one person, making user isolation redundant
- **Old Structure**: `users/{userId}/devices/{deviceName}/usage/{date}`
- **New Structure**: `devices/{deviceName}/usage/{date}`
- **Migration**: Created new simplified security rules template

### Critical Bug Fixes
1. **Result.try() Breaking Issue**:
   - Discovered that `Result.try()` from @praha/byethrow was not executing properly
   - Fixed by replacing all `Result.try()` calls with standard try-catch blocks
   - Affected methods: collection(), doc(), getDoc(), setDoc(), queryCollection(), docExists()

2. **Program Hanging on Exit**:
   - Commands would complete but not exit properly
   - Root cause: Firebase connections not being disconnected
   - Solution: Added cleanup function that calls disconnect() after CLI execution

3. **Device Document Creation**:
   - Device documents were not being created during sync
   - Fixed setDoc() to properly handle Firebase operations
   - Added lastSyncTimestamp updates to device documents

4. **sync-devices Command Issues**:
   - Command showed "0 devices" even when devices existed
   - Fixed queryCollection() to properly return results
   - Last sync dates now properly displayed

### Authentication Flow Changes
- Removed complex user ID management
- Simplified to use anonymous auth without persistent user tracking
- Each Firebase project now considered single-user

### Command Improvements
1. **sync-enable**: Added logic to handle re-enabling sync without re-prompting for device name
2. **sync-setup**: Updated to show simplified security rules
3. **sync-devices**: Now properly shows device list with last sync timestamps

### Security Rules Update
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Allow authenticated users full access to everything
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Known Issues
1. **TypeScript Errors**: ~473 type errors remain, mainly:
   - Result type narrowing issues
   - Missing type annotations in debug scripts
   - Unsafe any usage throughout codebase
   
2. **Sync Statistics**: sync-status shows 0 for all statistics (not recording usage stats)

3. **Debug Scripts**: Created during debugging have lint errors but aren't critical

### Testing Summary
All sync commands tested and working:
- ✅ sync-init: Shows overwrite prompt correctly
- ✅ sync-setup: Displays updated rules and indexes
- ✅ sync-enable: Handles re-enabling properly
- ✅ sync-disable: Disables sync correctly
- ✅ sync-status: Shows connection status (stats issue noted)
- ✅ sync-now: Syncs data and updates timestamps
- ✅ sync-devices: Lists devices with sync dates

## Next Steps
